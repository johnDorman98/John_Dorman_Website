    <h1>Hello I'm John!</h1>

    <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is John, I am 24 years old and have been interested in software development and programming for as long as I can remember.
            I have always wanted to get into the field having grown up around technology.
        </p>
        <p>
            It started with one of my early childhood passions, video games I was always intrigued as to how the games were coded and designed.
            As I grew older my interest in trying to understand how programs and games were created didn't go away it only evolved.
            More recently, I have found myself interested in blockchain technologies and is something I plan to play around with and get an understand of.
            Along side the blockchain technology I am also interested in other fields such as cloud technologies, AI and machine learning.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now that I have been creating some of my own programs and projects, I have only found myself even more deeply invested and interested in
            the world of software engineering. I love everything to do with it one of my favorite feelings has been overcoming a difficult project or task that has
            been challenging to complete.
        </p>
